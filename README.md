##Detailed Usage
####Configuration Page
By opening the MyLOL configuration settings within the Pebble Time app, you will be greeted with a screen as shown below. The first input box is for entering a MyLOL Messenger username (see first config page image). A MyLOL Messenger username will allow you to send pebble to pebble messages through the pebble app to other MyLOL Messenger users. The next section of the configuration page is for entering a desired summoner name and server region combination. This is required to make use of RIOT's API's so that game data associated to the account can be acquired. After entering a valid username and summoner profile data, you can select the 'SUBMIT' button to save these settings (see second config page image).

The next time the configuration page is opened, you will see your MyLOL Messenger username along with an input box for entering other MyLOL Messenger usernames (see third config page image). You will also be able to change your summoner profile settings. Usernames added in the config page will show up in the 'Messenger' menu of the pebble app.
